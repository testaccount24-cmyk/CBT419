//*     (particularly, the regular expression routines in grep)     *   FILE 419

//*     extract the function, adjust the prologue/epilogue          *   FILE 419
//*     correctly and include these in your own programs.   The     *   FILE 419
//*     code is non-rent, and uses R12 as the base register and     *   FILE 419
//*     R13 as the frame base register.  You should replace         *   FILE 419
//*     DCCPRLG and DCCEPIL with the appropriate function           *   FILE 419
//*     entry/exit macros.  The FRAMESIZE parameter on DCCPRLG      *   FILE 419
//*     indicates how much dynamic storage the routine will         *   FILE 419
